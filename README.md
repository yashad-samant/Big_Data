# Big_Data
This course was taught by Dr. Sangmi Pallickara where she covered the basics of Big Data on Hadoop distributed system using MapReduce. THere were also basics of AWS, hbase, hive covered in this course. I have uploaded one of the major assignments and project for this course. For the project, I tried using Apache Spark but it failed so ended up doing the project on Hadoop.
